## Project structure
I have used `React` to build this application. `react-bootstrap` is used for common components and styling of the application.

Fetch API is used to fetch data from `/surveys` and `/surveys/{id}` endpoints. Used react hooks and functional components to keep application code simple and maintainable.

Written basic unit test cases using `testing-library`. Code coverage is kept to a lower end; to showcase the variety of tests to cover functional and UI aspects of the application.
